The bit_math project is an attempt to provide a library to manipulate 
arbitrarily large integers and perform calculations efficiently.
Its next step would be to introduce rational numbers, and then also series and sums.

My vision is to make a framework in which you could represent
irrational numbers (by infinite sums such as for e^x = sum_over_n(x^n/n!))
and efficiently generate it to any required percision.

Feedbacks are very wellcome.
